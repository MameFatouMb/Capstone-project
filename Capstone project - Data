In this section, I will describe the data I will use to solve this problem. 

I will select the popular places where people like to go. Because these places 
are very frequented by people and so after good hours of shopping or cinema, they are probably hungry.
To do that, I will use Foursquare location data to select the most popular places in Paris. 
I will first use a geolocator to get the longitude and latitude of Paris and then I will pass it on the 
url calling Foursquare API. I will use the exploring mode while calling at Foursquare. 
This will return me several data about popular places such as name, id, categories, longitude, latitude, address â€¦
