Because these places are very frequented by people and so after good hours of shopping or cinema, they are probably hungry.\nTo do that, I will use Foursquare location data to select the most popular places in Paris. I will first use a geolocator to get the longitude and latitude of Paris and then I will pass it on the url calling Foursquare API. I will use the exploring mode while calling at Foursquare. This will return me several data about popular places such as name, id, categories, longitude, latitude, address \u2026",
